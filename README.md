# **NZTG QA FINAL SUBMISSION**
Firstly before we begin please ensure that mocha, chai and puppeteer are installed as the node modules folder was omitted.
An example for installing these modules would be to type `npm install mocha` into the command line. 

To use this repository simply clone it to a folder of choice, change your command directory to this new folder and enter `npm run test`. The script for this test can be found by opening the `appTest.js` file located in the test folder.

There 3 test cases within this test, testing out unique scenarios and different features of the Youtube.com website. Feel free to add, remove or chagne the provided links and search queries within the script.<br/>
